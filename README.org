* File and Directory Types

- *Modular*

  Template modules are templates which are not stand-alone, but which are
  used in rendering other templates.

  A file is considered a template module if its name or names of
  any of its parent directories are prefixed with '_'.

- *Private*

  Private files are neither rendered nor used as template modules.

  A file is considered private if its name or names of any of
  its parent directories are prefixed with '.'.

- *Static*

  Static files are not processed by Jinja2 and just copied to the
  corresponding directory instead.

- *Pandoc*

  Files to be processed with Pandoc.

      the next run, or compartmentalise the user templates from the
      automatically generated templates
 - Watcher
    + watch for changes in static and pandoc-processed directories
 - Global parameters
    + Add the option of supplying global parameters to jinja2
